# Ruby_Assignment1

ASSIGNMENT:

There are three tab-delimited data files:
1. seed_stock_data.tsv
2. gene_information.tsv
3. cross_data.tsv

#1 contains information about seeds in your genebank
#2 contains information about genes
#3 contains information about the crosses you have made

Each file begins with a heading line, followed by lines of data


************ YOUR TASKS **************
Your task is to use Object-oriented programming to achieve two things:
1) "simulate" planting 7 grams of seeds from each of the records in the seed stock genebank
then you should update the genebank information to show the new quantity of seeds
that remain after a planting. The new state of the genebank
should be printed to a new file, using exactly the same format as the
original file seed_stock_data.tsv

-- if the amount of seed is reduced to zero or less than zero, then
a friendly warning message should appear on the screen. The amount
of seed left in the gene bank is, of course, not LESS than zero guiÃ±o


2) process the information in cross_data.tsv and determine which genes are
genetically-linked. To achieve this, you will have to do a Chi-square test
on the F2 cross data. If you discover genes that are linked, this information
should be added as a property of each of the genes (they are both linked to each
other).


***************************************

Hints:
*** You will need to create 3 Objects:
1. A Class for the Gene
2. A Class for the SeedStock
3. A Class for the Hybrid Cross

*** the values of some Object Properties will be other Objects

*** the seed_stock ID is the key to link seed_stock_data->cross_data

*** the GeneID is the key to link gene_information->seed_stock_data


-------------------

The output of your program should look like this:
$ ruby process_database.rb  gene_information.tsv  seed_stock_data.tsv  cross_data.tsv  new_stock_file.tsv
WARNING: we have run out of Seed Stock B52
WARNING: we have run out of Seed Stock A51
Recording: ufo is genetically linked to pi with chisquare score 32.2794279427943

Final Report:
ufo is linked to pi
pi is linked to ufo

-------------------
Your program should also create the tab-delimited updated new_stock_file.tsv that contains:
Seed_Stock Mutant_Gene_ID Last_Planted Storage Grams_Remaining

A348 AT4G36920 8/2/2015 cama25 5
B3334 AT3G54340 8/2/2015 cama18 15
A334 AT1G69120 8/2/2015 cama2 21
A51 AT1G30950 8/2/2015 cama25 0
